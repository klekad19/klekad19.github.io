<p>The tiger is the largest living cat species. It is most recognisable for its orange skin color and for its black stripes. It is an apex predator. It primarily hunts big animals like: deers, elephants, etc. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, then become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.
